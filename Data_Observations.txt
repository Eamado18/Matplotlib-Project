Observations and Insights on the Data Collected: 
   - Based on the summary statistics table for the tumor volume for each regimen, Ramicane had the lowest tumor volume average. Capomulin came a close second 
     demonstrating there was a better performance found in the another treatment that was not Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin.
   - Another insight and observation founded in the data, specifically a bar plot, shows Capomulin having the most number of timpoints for all the mice tested. 
     Ramicane came close second. 
   - Even though Capomulin showed massive effectiveness, according the correlation coefficient and linear regression model, effectiveness is based on the weight 
      of each mouse. The smaller the mice the smaller the tumor, and the more effective the drug is.
